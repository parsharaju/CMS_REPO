1. Saving information on servers 
When comparing stateless and stateful protocols and the architecture on which they are built, the most glaring difference is how both protocols handle data. For the stateless protocol, storing data is not a priority. Therefore, the servers used as part of the network’s infrastructure do not have to be built to store large amounts of information. 

In stateless protocols, data is not transient and does not have to be stored permanently on the servers. The bulk of the responsibility for saving information lies on the client, storing data as a cache. Also, restarting the server simply means starting a new operation with no significant data loss.

On the other hand, stateful applications depend on a server capable of storing large amounts of information. It can be pretty complex to manage the entire life cycle of an application that uses the stateful protocol. The administrators must also ensure that the proper backing storage is used. The stateful protocol requires servers to save the information of an ongoing transaction as it can be referenced in future transactions. 1. Saving information on servers
